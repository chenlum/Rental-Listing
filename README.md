# Rental-Listing
This project is called Rental Listing Inquiries, originally a Kaggle competition dating
back to 2 years ago. RentHop is a search engine for apartments by using data to sort
rental listings by quality. However, while it is widely acknowledged that finding a perfect
apartment is difficult, sorting all available real estate data programmatically is even
more challenging.
It will help ease this problem using data mining methods by predicting the
respective probability of a listing falling into three interest levels based on given features
(number of bathrooms, number of bedrooms, building id, listing created time,
description, display address, a list of features of the apartment, latitude, listing id,
longitude, manager id, a list of photo links, price, street address).
